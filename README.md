# Welcome to Idle Economy!

##### Thank you for visiting my website!

>❗❗This page is currently under construction and will be completed in upcoming updates.
>Sorry for the inconvenience! 

This is a simple incremental game which was made using with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You can visit the website [here](https://flothaboss1000.github.io/Idle-Economy/).

Also visit CHANGELOG.md for update logs for this site.

## How it Works
The game includes two types of currency:

 - Cash (💵)
 - Gem (💎)

> As of now, there is no way of naturally obtaining gems. See **Admin
> Console** to obtain gems manually.

You can earn cash by:

 - Working
 - Hiring

### Working
Work allows you to earn cash manually. There are a lot of options on how to work and you can unlock them one by one.

The title of the work shows the amount of cash earned after finishing the task. It is shown in the green text.

The 'Work' button also shows the time it will take to finish the work. It is displayed inside the parenthesis.

Excluding the first work (begging), these works will require you to unlock them by cash. The finish time and amount of cash paid after work will increase from one work to the next.

### Hiring
Along with working manually, you can hire people to earn money from your behalf, allowing you to earn money while being inactive. As with work, there is a variety of people to unlock and hire.




## How to Play

Start making cash by working manually. You will start your work by **begging**.

Click on the **'Work'** button to start working. The progress bar below starts to fill and completes in a second.

Once you have enough cash, you can unlock the next work


## Admin Console
Along with a functioning system, this site also comes with an admin console that allows you to manually configure the site settings.

> I would not recommend using the console unless you want to use it for experimental purposes

The combination for calling the admin console is:
#### Ctrl + Alt + Q
This shortcut initiates a prompt that asks you to enter a valid command.

The following are the commands available in the admin console as well as more information about them.

| Command | Description | Input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| setbal | Sets the cash balance | Number |
| addbal | Adds to the current cash balance | Number |
| subbal | Subtracts from the current cash balance | Number |
| setgem | Sets the gem balance | Number |
| addgem | Adds to the current gem balance | Number |
| subgem | Subtracts from the current gem balance | Number |
