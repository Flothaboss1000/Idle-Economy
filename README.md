# Welcome to Idle Economy!

**Thank you for visiting my website!**

>❗❗This page is currently under construction and will be completed in upcoming updates.
>Sorry for the inconvenience! 

This is a simple incremental game which was made using with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You can visit the website [here](https://flothaboss1000.github.io/Idle-Economy/).

Also visit [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Flothaboss1000/Idle-Economy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for update logs for this site.

## How it Works
The game includes two types of currency:

 - Cash (💵)
 - Gem (💎)

You can earn cash by:

 - Working
 - Hiring
 - Lootboxes

### Working
Work allows you to earn cash manually. There are a lot of options on how to work and you can unlock them one by one.

The title of the work shows the amount of cash earned after finishing the task. It is shown in green text.

The 'Work' button also shows the time it will take to finish the work. It is displayed inside the parenthesis.

Excluding the first work (begging), these works will require you to unlock them by cash. The finish time and amount of cash paid after work will increase from one work to the next.

### Hiring
Along with working manually, you can hire people to earn money from your behalf, allowing you to earn money while being inactive. As with work, there is a variety of people to unlock and hire.

The green text in the title of the hire shows the amount of cash earned every second. You can see the net automatic earnings in the statistics.

The cost of the different categories of hire will increase with from one to the next. You can hire an unlimited number of people from each category, but the cost of hiring them will increase as well.  

### Lootboxes
Lootboxes are items that give rewards when opened, depending on the loot available. The price and the stakes of the lootboxes increase with each tier.
The rates for the prizes as well as failure is listed along every lootbox.
**They are the only natural source of obtaining gems as of now.**

Once you buy a lootbox, a big popup will appear, followed by a message inside the popup telling you what you have won. 

### Inventory
You can own collectibles and keep them with yourself permanently. You can buy them directly with gems.
They also provide you with a permanent cash multiplier, which increases your passive earnings. The multiplier depends on the rarity and cost of the item.
You can see the net multiplier in the statistics.
You can own multiple items of the same kind, but their price will increase after each purchase.

### GoTo
Since the entire webpage is too long, a bookmark feature is added at the bottom right corner of the screen called 'GoTo' which allows you to automatically move up and down to the desired section

## How to Play

Start making cash by working manually. You will start your work by **begging**.
Click on the **'Work'** button to start working. The progress bar below starts to fill and completes in a second.
Once you have enough cash, you can unlock the next work and increase your earnings this way.

You can also get money by **hiring** people for different tasks. This way you will get a passive income every second.
You will start by hiring a **dog**. Click on the '**Hire**' button for the dog. You will start earning cash automatically. You can hire the next person in the list once you have enough cash.

If you feel lucky, you can open a **lootbox**. The first lootbox is an **Amateur Chest**. 
You can click on the '**Buy**' button to purchase it and get a cash prize or nothing.
You can buy more expensive lootboxes and get a chance to earn a gem from one of them.

You can also purchase collectibles and permanent multiplier. Click on the **'buy '** button to own the item.

# Save

You have the ability to save your progress, which means you can come back where you left from, whether by reloading the page or closing the browser window altogether.

>⚠Please note that this feature is experimental and may not be able to retain your progress when a new update arrives

In order to enable the option to save your session at the first place, you will need to accept the site's cookies, since it uses your device's storage to store and retrive your progress locally.

Once you accept the cookies, you will be immediately granted the options to save your session. 

There are three ways to save your progress. 
1. One way is to go to Configuration section and click on Save session. This will save all data in the session upto this point for future retrieval.
2.  The second way is to click on the down arrow button at the corner of the site. This does the same thing but is more accessible
3. The third way is to enable Auto-save in the Configuration section. This saves your progress automatically every 5 minutes as well as at the moment you close/reload the site.

You can return to the last saved session with the Restore Last Session button in the Configuration section. Once you confirm your decision, all progress from the last saved session will be reverted.

You can also do a hard reset, erasing the current session as well as any saved session. You will be prompted to confirm your decision, after which all user data will be erased and return to the absolute beginning of the site.

## Admin Console
Along with a functioning system, this site also comes with an admin console that allows you to manually configure the site settings.

> I would not recommend using the console unless you want to use it for experimental purposes

The combination for calling the admin console is **Ctrl + Alt + Q**.
This shortcut initiates a prompt that asks you to enter a valid command.
If opening for the first time, it will ask you to confirm to enable experimental mode for the session

The following are the commands available in the admin console as well as more information about them.

| Command | Description | Input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| setbal | Sets the cash balance | Number |
| addbal | Adds to the current cash balance | Number |
| subbal | Subtracts from the current cash balance | Number |
| setgem | Sets the gem balance | Number |
| addgem | Adds to the current gem balance | Number |
| subgem | Subtracts from the current gem balance | Number |
| reset | Resets the cash and gem balance to zero | Confirm |
